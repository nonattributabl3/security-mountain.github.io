Two-Factor authentication provides an added layer of security to ensure that only you have access to your accounts. Most banks require this already, while most email services and social media have the option available for new logins. Go into your accounts and check that this is enabled. You will likely then login using a combination of your password in the browser, and an authentication app on your phone.

      <p class="text">
Having strong, unique and non-attributable passwords is vital to basic online security. Simple or common passwords are very easy to crack, and anything that includes personal information, such as your pet’s name or date of birth, are quite easy to guess by anyone with some basic personal details on you. One useful method is to choose three random words, and use these three words with a number and a special character as the basis of your passwords. This will make sure they are sufficiently long, random and un-personal to be very secure. It is also much easier to remember than a random string of letters and numbers. Make sure your bank, email and primary apps all have a strong and unique password attached to them.

In conjunction with checking privacy settings, think about your other (non-sensitive) content that is out there on the internet.

Follow the 3-2-1 Rule: For any important data, there should be 3 copies of the data, on 2 different media, with 1 copy being kept off site. The final step ensures your data is still safe in the case of non-cyber threats, such as theft or perhaps a house fire.
This might take a bit longer to put in place, but it is definitely worth doing. Consider buying a harddrive to keep your important data backups on. Store it somewhere accessible, but make sure to keep it separate from your main data location.

      <p class="text">
     •	
IoT devices are often in high demand, produced quickly with only minimal security measures. Your devices, on the other hand, often have higher levels of security. By placing IoT devices and computers on separate networks, you ensure that network access to your important devices is not compromised by the lesser security of your IoT devices.
Here is a quick guide to do this, with a range of other useful info on securing IoT devices:

Most browsers ask if you want to save passwords in the browser itself.

Whether you want to sync these passwords between different devices is up to you, but might be a good idea if each of those devices is well-secured in themselves.

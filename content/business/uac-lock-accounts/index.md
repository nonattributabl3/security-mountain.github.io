title: Lock accounts after no more than 10 unsuccessful attempts 
date: "2022-08-13T211:10:03.284Z"
description: "This is key to stopping a brute-force attack, where an attacker attempts to gain access by forcefully trying all possible combinations of login credentials in order to gain unauthorised access. You can easily unlock their account when you verify no malicious intention from an administrator's account. This is usually preferred over a timed lockout duration which increases with the number of unsuccessful attempts to gain access."

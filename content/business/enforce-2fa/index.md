description: "Two-factor authentication is when an individual must provide 2 methods to verify their identity. The most common form would be an SMS Token. We strongly advise using 2FA on every application within your business, regardless of how critical you believe it is. Two-factor can be setup extremely easily on email accounts and for more complex solutions consider Authy or Google Authenticator."

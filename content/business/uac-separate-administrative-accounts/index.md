title: Use separate accounts to perform administrative activities only

description: "Using separate accounts to perform privileged actions is mandatory. Allowing the same accounts used for day-to-day activitiy to perform administractive actions can lead to privilege-exploitation and additionally make it much harder to use logs to analyse any network activity in event of an attack. Consider having different administrative accounts for different sections of your business to further aid in compartmentalisation."

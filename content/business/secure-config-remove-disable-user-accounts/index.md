title: Remove or disable user accounts when no longer required, in particular special access accounts
date: "2022-08-13T211:10:03.284Z"
description: "Just as you would never keep data for longer than permitted under data law, you should never keep a user account for longer than necessary. A stray account with high-level privilege can easily undermime your network, especially when an attacker makes use of their hidden position within your network. As soon as accounts are not required, remove them and keep an eye on inactive accounts."
